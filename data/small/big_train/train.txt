3510, O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , Traders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties -- three percent import tax and 17 percent value-added tax -- that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise .

6273, B-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , South Africa 's truth commission begins issuing subpoenas this week in a bid to dig beneath the political rationales and find the sinister figures who have the blood of the country 's race war on their hands . 
6274, O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ," Leaders of the major parties involved , from right-wing whites to radical blacks , appeared before Archbishop Desmond Tutu 's Truth and Reconciliation Commission last week to paint the broad picture of their actions for or against apartheid . "
6275, O O O O O B-PER I-PER I-PER O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ," Most , including former president F.W. de Klerk and African National Congress Deputy President Thabo Mbeki , offered apologies for any mistakes they had made and accepted broad responsibility for the actions of their foot soldiers . "
6276, O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O , But none named those guilty of ordering or carrying out any of the gross violations of human rights which Tutu is investigating . 
6277, O O O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ," Human rights lawyer Brian Currin said the hearings last week were not intended as a form of confessional and that those who personally committed crimes during apartheid would testify only before a separate arm of the commission , the amnesty committee . "
6278, O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ,"   I do n't think one should have expected more than what one got ,   he said .   "
6279, O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , That was not the amnesty committee where perpetrators are expected to open their hearts and souls and to tell it all .   
6280, O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ," The commission , which has the power to grant amnesty to those who confess to abuses , has begun hearing the testimony from people already in jail for their deeds . "
6281, O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O ," But others , such as self-confessed secret police hit-squad leader Dirk Coetzee , have yet to testify . "
6282, B-PER O O O O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ," Tutu 's deputy chairman , Alex Boraine , told reporters the commission would begin issuing subpoenas to suspects who refused to appear voluntarily some time this week . "
6283, O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O , He added that former hardline apartheid president P.W. Botha could be among those called . 
6284, O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ," But Currin , who is advising several people regarded as perpetrators , said this was not the best way to achieve the commission 's aims . "
6285, O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ,"   A person can be forced to appear , but the only way one is going to get to the truth in its totality is if people feel it is a good idea to go to the amnesty committee . "
6286, O O O O O O O O O O , At the moment this is not the case .   
6287, O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ," He cited Coetzee , who was charged with murder after confessing in media interviews to dirty tricks . "
6288, O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , His trial is due to start in December but the truth commission intends to decide on his amnesty application before that . 
6289, B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , Currin said the law had to be changed so all judicial prosecutions were automatically suspended for those who approached the truth commission . 
6290, O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O B-PER I-PER O B-ORG I-ORG O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O B-PER I-PER O O B-MISC I-MISC O O ," Last week 's submissions to the commission by the ANC , de Klerk 's National Party and the right-wing Freedom Front of General Constand Viljoen left many South Africans unsatisfied . "
6291, B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ," Boraine said the picture was incomplete because officers of the apartheid-era security forces had yet to make their scheduled , separate submission , but one black caller to a radio talk show declared : "
6292, O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ,"   This whole thing is utterly useless , it does n't help us at all . "

6294, O O B-PER I-PER O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ," Political scientist Jannie Gagiano said he doubted that the National Party , which implemented apartheid in 1948 and began dismantling it in 1990 , felt it carried a burden of guilt and needed to be exculpated through the commission . "
6295, O O O O O O O O O O O O O ,   Therefore I have some doubts about achieving some form of reconciliation . 
6296, O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ," One has to feel a bit guilty to feel the need for reconciling yourself to a historical adversary ,   he said . "

7413, O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ,"   I still feel it 's embarrassing what happened and I was about to pull out yesterday and say , ' That 's it , '   said Stich , one of a host of men who cried foul over seeding procedures that forced an unprecedented remaking of the men 's draw last week . "
7414, O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ,"   But there are so many reasons to play , especially spectators and the kids who come out here and want to enjoy watching tennis , that I decided to stay .   "
7415, O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC O O ," In a break from tradition , the Open did not seed in strict accordance with ATP rankings , instead taking into account other factors that raised objections of favourtism toward U.S. players . "
7416, O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O B-MISC I-MISC O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC O ," One prominent player that did not stay for the Open was French Open champion Yvegeny Kafelnikov , who after being dropped three spots from his ATP ranking to a seventh seeding , withdrew and returned home to Russia . "
7417, B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O , Kafelnikov had pulled out of last week 's tournament with a rib injury . 
7418, O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC B-MISC I-MISC O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O ," At a news conference attended by approximately 50 players on Sunday , U.S. Davis Cup player Todd Martin expressed the players ' outrage at the seedings . "
7419, O O O O B-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O ,"   The way the U.S. Open has seeded here , tampering with the ranking system , has tarnished the image and reputation of this U.S. Open in the players ' mind , and we think that is damaging to our sport ,   Martin said . "
7420, B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O , Stich said he felt the players ought to have organised an active protest . 
7421, O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O ,   I feel that we made it a little easy for the USTA . 
7422, O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O ," They did n't really get hurt as much as I think they should have ,   said Stich .   "
7423, O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ," I feel that we should have maybe just cancelled out the Monday , not show up today and start the tournament tomorrow .   "
7424, O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC O ," But once the 27-year-old Stich got on the court , he focused his energies on trying to win the year 's last Grand Slam . "
7425, O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O B-MISC O O , He took a positive first step with his 6-3 1-6 6-1 7-5 win over compatriot Haas on a sun-baked Grandstand court .

"
7427, O O O O O O O B-PER O O O B-MISC I-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ," The suspicion , however , lingers in Stich 's mind that U.S. Open officials did tamper with the seeding process in order to benefit homegrown players . "
7428, O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O B-MISC O O B-PER I-PER O ,"   I get the feeling that everything is done here for the American players and they forget about all the other players ,   said Stich , who lost the 1994 Open final to Andre Agassi . "
7429, O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O , It was Agassi who was at the centre of the controversy that engulfed the tournament since the original draw was completed on Wednesday . 
7430, O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O O , The flamboyant American star was bumped up two spots from his ATP ranking of eight to a seeding of six . 
7431, O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC O B-MISC O ,"   He ( Agassi ) should be seeded the way he is playing tennis right now ,   said Stich about the unfairness of moving up Agassi , who made early exits from the French Open and Wimbledon . "
7432, B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O ," Stich , not seeded here for the first time since 1990 , might have benefitted from some fiddling with the seedings himself after Kafelnikov withdrew . "
7433, O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O B-LOC O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O O O ," Ranked 18th in the world , Stich might have been slipped into that spot ahead of Spain 's Felix Mantilla , who is 16th but had never been played in the Open and had been left out of the seedings originally . "
7434, O B-PER O O O O O O O O , But Stich did n't want to play that game . 
7435, O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O ,"   I think he deserves to be seeded as everybody else who is in the top 16 deserves to be seeded ,   Stich said . "

14849, O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O B-ORG O O O B-PER O O O , The outcome of the November elections emerged as a hot topic on Wall Street this week as financial pundits debated whether Robert Rubin might forgo a second term as Treasury secretary if President Clinton is re-elected . 
14850, O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O , Concern centred on the currency markets since Rubin 's tour de force has been his unflagging support of the dollar . 
14851, O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O B-MISC O O B-LOC O O O , Speculation that Rubin might not stay in his post grew after he sidestepped questions about any future Cabinet post during television interviews at the Democratic convention in Chicago this week . 
14852, O B-PER O O B-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O ," Should Rubin leave , Wall Street would worry that he might take his strong-dollar policy with him . "
14853, B-PER O O O O B-ORG O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC O ," Rubin 's predecessor at the Treasury , Lloyd Bentsen , was viewed with suspicion by some in the financial markets who thought he had tried to push down the dollar to gain an edge in trade negotiations with Japan . "
14854, O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O B-PER O O B-LOC O O O O O O O O O ,"   Obviously , under the Clinton administration , we 've seen two distinctively different dollar policies ,   said Chris Widness , an international economist at Chase Securities Inc.   Under Rubin , the U.S. has certainly looked for a strong dollar .   "
14855, O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-MISC I-MISC I-MISC O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O ," That strategy , backed up by timely instances of joint central bank intervention , helped the dollar battle back from post-Second World War lows of 1.3438 German marks on March 8 , 1995 , and 79.75 Japanese yen on April 19 , 1995 . "
14856, O O O O O O O O O O O O O ," Currently , the dollar stands at about 1.48 marks and 109 yen . "

14859, O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER I-PER O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ,"   Rubin has done a fine job in that position ,   said Michael Faust , a portfolio manager at Bailard , Biehl and Kaiser , which manages just under $ 1 billion in global stocks and bonds . "
14860, O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ,   Anyone who would come in there to replace him would have awfully big shoes to fill .   
14861, O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O B-MISC O O O O O O O O , Fear that a new Treasury secretary might favour a return to Bentsen-era policy could spell trouble for financial markets . 
14862, O O O O O O O O B-LOC O O O O O O O O O O O O O , Some overseas investors might shy away from buying U.S. stocks and bonds or even sell them when the dollar is weakening . 
14863, O O B-ORG I-ORG O O B-PER O O B-PER I-PER O O O O O O B-ORG I-ORG O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O B-ORG O ," As for U.S. Treasury securities , Widness explained that Alan Greenspan 's reappointment as chairman of the Federal Reserve and the outlook for the federal budget were more important than whether Rubin continues at the Treasury . "
14864, O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC O O O B-PER O O O O O B-LOC O O O O O O O O O O ,"   Although , if we did get someone that was seen as looking for a dollar depreciation , it would probably hurt capital flows to the United States ,   said Widness , adding that could hurt U.S. stocks and , to a lesser degree , bonds . "
14865, O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O O O O O ," Still , markets may have little to fear from any Rubin successor because the firm dollar policy has yielded positive results . "
14866, O O O O O O O O B-ORG O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O B-LOC I-LOC O O O O O O O ," If that is true , then any new Treasury chief would need to be as effective as Rubin in convincing markets that the White House does indeed want a strong currency . "
14867, O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O ,"   If he left , the first question people would ask the next guy is , ' What 's your view on the dollar ? ' "

14869, O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-PER O O O O O O O B-PER O O O ,"   And all I can say as a piece of advice is that they 'd better say exactly the same thing ( as Rubin ) , if not stronger ,   Perelstein said .   "
