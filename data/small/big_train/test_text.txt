3, Japan began the defence of their Asian Cup title with a lucky 2-1 win against Syria in a Group C championship match on Friday . 
4," But China saw their luck desert them in the second match of the group , crashing to a surprise 2-0 defeat to newcomers Uzbekistan . "
5, China controlled most of the match and saw several chances missed until the 78th minute when Uzbek striker Igor Shkvyrin took advantage of a misdirected defensive header to lob the ball over the advancing Chinese keeper and into an empty net . 
6," Oleg Shatskiku made sure of the win in injury time , hitting an unstoppable left foot shot from just outside the area . "
7, The former Soviet republic was playing in an Asian Cup finals tie for the first time . 
8," Despite winning the Asian Games title two years ago , Uzbekistan are in the finals as outsiders . "
9, Two goals from defensive errors in the last six minutes allowed Japan to come from behind and collect all three points from their opening meeting against Syria . 
10," Takuya Takagi scored the winner in the 88th minute , rising to head a Hiroshige Yanagimoto cross towards the Syrian goal which goalkeeper Salem Bitar appeared to have covered but then allowed to slip into the net . "
11, It was the second costly blunder by Syria in four minutes . 
12, Defender Hassan Abbas rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of Bitar 's goal . 
13, Nader Jokhadar had given Syria the lead with a well-struck header in the seventh minute . 
14, Japan then laid siege to the Syrian penalty area for most of the game but rarely breached the Syrian defence . 
15, Bitar pulled off fine saves whenever they did . 
16, Japan coach Shu Kamo said : ' ' The Syrian own goal proved lucky for us . 
17, The Syrians scored early and then played defensively and adopted long balls which made it hard for us . ' 
18, ' 
19," Japan , co-hosts of the World Cup in 2002 and ranked 20th in the world by FIFA , are favourites to regain their title here . "

202, Centre Jason Little will miss Australia 's end-of-tour fixture against the Barbarians at Twickenham on Saturday . 
203, Little has opted not to risk aggravating the knee injury which ruled him out of a large chunk of the tour and is replaced by fellow Queenslander Daniel Herbert . 
204, Owen Finegan has recovered from the knocks he took in last weekend 's test against Wales and retains his place in the back-row ahead of Daniel Manu . 
205, The Wallabies have their sights set on a 13th successive victory to end their European tour with a 100 percent record but also want to turn on the style and provide David Campese with a fitting send-off in his final match in Australian colours . 
206," The Wallabies currently have no plans to make any special presentation to the 34-year-old winger but a full house of 75,000 spectators will still gather in the hope of witnessing one last moment of magic . "
207," Campese will be up against a familiar foe in the shape of Barbarians captain Rob Andrew , the man who kicked Australia to defeat with a last-ditch drop-goal in the World Cup quarter-final in Cape Town . "
208,"   Campo has a massive following in this country and has had the public with him ever since he first played here in 1984 ,   said Andrew , also likely to be making his final Twickenham appearance . "
209," On tour , Australia have won all four tests against Italy , Scotland , Ireland and Wales , and scored 414 points at an average of almost 35 points a game . "
210," League duties restricted the Barbarians ' selectorial options but they still boast 13 internationals including England full-back Tim Stimpson and recalled wing Tony Underwood , plus All Black forwards Ian Jones and Norm Hewitt . "

248, MELBOURNE 1996-12-06 
249, Australia gave Brian Lara another reason to be miserable when they beat West Indies by five wickets in the opening World Series limited overs match on Friday . 
250," Lara , disciplined for misconduct on Wednesday , was dismissed for five to extend a disappointing run of form on tour . "
251," Australia , who hold a 2-0 lead in the five-match test series , overhauled West Indies ' total of 172 all out with eight balls to spare to end a run of six successive one-day defeats . "
252," All-rounder Greg Blewett steered his side to a comfortable victory with an unbeaten 57 in 90 balls to the delight of the 42,442 crowd . "
253, Man-of-the match Blewett came to the wicket with the total on 70 for two and hit three fours during an untroubled innings lasting 129 minutes . 
254," His crucial fifth-wicket partnership with fellow all-rounder Stuart Law , who scored 21 , added 71 off 85 balls . "
255, Lara looked out of touch during his brief stay at the crease before chipping a simple catch to Shane Warne at mid-wicket . 
256, West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd has apologised for Lara 's behaviour on Tuesday . 
257, He ( Lara ) had told Australia coach Geoff Marsh that wicketkeeper Ian Healy was unwelcome in the visitors ' dressing room . 
258," The Melbourne crowd were clearly angered by the incident , loudly jeering the West Indies vice-captain as he walked to the middle . "
259, It was left to fellow left-hander Shivnarine Chanderpaul to hold the innings together with a gritty 54 despite the handicap of an injured groin . 
260, Chanderpaul was forced to rely on a runner for most of his innings after hurting himself as he scurried back to his crease to avoid being run out . 
261," Pakistan , who arrive in Australia later this month , are the other team competing in the World Series tournament . "

317, CRICKET - LARA SUFFERS MORE AUSTRALIAN TOUR MISERY . 
318, MELBOURNE 1996-12-06 
319," West Indies batsman Brian Lara suffered another blow to his Australian tour , after already being disciplined for misconduct , when he was dismissed cheaply in the first limited overs match against Australia on Friday . "
320," Lara , who earned a stern rebuke from his own tour management after an angry outburst against Australia wicketkeeper Ian Healy , scored five to prolong a run of poor form with the bat . "
321, The West Indies vice-captain struggled for timing during his 36-minute stay at the crease before chipping a ball from medium pacer Tom Moody straight to Shane Warne at mid-wicket . 
322, West Indies were 53 for two in 15 overs when rain stopped play at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after captain Courtney Walsh won the toss and elected to bat . 
323, Lara 's outburst three days ago has clearly turned some of the Australian public against him . 
324, As he walked to the wicket he was greeted by loud jeers from sections of the crowd . 
325," On several occasions during his innings , the crowd joined together in a series of obscene chants against him . "
326, Tour manager Clive Lloyd on Wednesday apologised for Lara 's behaviour in confronting Australia coach Geoff Marsh in the opposition dressing room to protest against his dismissal in the second test on Tuesday . 
327, Lloyd did not say what form the discipline would take . 
328," Lara , who holds the record for the highest score in test and first-class cricket , was unhappy about Healy 's role in the incident and questioned whether the ball had carried to the Australia keeper . "
329, Australia went on to win the match at the Sydney Cricket Ground by 124 runs to take a two-nil lead in the five-test series after Lara failed in both innings . 
330, Lara has yet to score a century since West Indies arrived in Australia five weeks ago . 
331," Both West Indies and Australia team management have played down the incident , stressing that relations between the two sides have not been adversely affected . "
332," Pakistan , who arrive next week , are the third team in the triangular World Series tournament . "

931," The victims were 18 and 20 , he said , adding one other youth had been wounded in the shooting . "

944,   I look forward to continuing our good relations ... 
945, with the United States and with the first woman ever to hold the position of Secretary of State . 
946," I wish her well ,   Havel said in a statement to Reuters . "
947," Havel , who helped lead the   velvet revolution   that ousted the Communist regime in Prague in 1989 , invited Albright , then working for a private foreign policy think tank , to advise his new democratic government in 1990 . "
948, Havel had a small malignant tumour removed from his lung on Monday and is recovering in hospital . 
949," Albright , born Marie Korbelova to a Czechoslovak diplomat in 1937 , fled with her family to the United States after the Communists came to power in a coup in 1948 . "

953," is a clear signal that one key of the lines of foreign policy will be the strengthening of the trans-Atlantic cooperation , a creation of strategic partnership between Europe and the US ,   Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told Reuters . "
954,   ( Albright ) is a convinced advocate of NATO enlargement and of stabilisation of security structures .   
955," Czech ambassador to the United Nations , Karel Kovanda , told the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes that Albright   is a little light in our diplomatic heaven ,   but warned against expecting her to exert any influence in favour of the Czechs . "

967, CZECH VICE-PM SEES WIDER DEBATE AT PARTY CONGRESS . 
968, PRAGUE 1996-12-06 
969," Saturday 's national congress of the ruling Czech Civic Democratic Party ( ODS ) will discuss making the party more efficient and transparent , Foreign Minister and ODS vice-chairman Josef Zieleniec , said on Friday . "
970,"   Modernisation and more profesionalism of the party 's structure , having financing of the party be more transparent ... "
971," are absolutely fundamental ,   Zieleniec , who is also vice-premier in the government , told Reuters . "
972," He said after June general elections in which the ruling three-party coalition lost its parliamentary majority , the ODS executive , led by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus , had developed proposals on these subjects to present at the congress on Saturday in the Czech second city Brno . "
973,"   I am convinced , that the congress will tackle these proposals ,   he said . "
974," The ODS , a party in which Klaus often tries to emulate the style of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , has been in control of Czech politics since winning general elections in 1992 . "
975," Zieleniec in the summer led calls for the party and its leadership to listen to more diverse opinions , a thinly-veiled criticism of Klaus who has spearheaded the country 's post-Communist economic reforms . "

981, POLAND GOT MONEY FROM POST-WAR SWISS ACCOUNTS .

984," Poland said on Friday that Swiss bank accounts , which in many cases belonged to Polish Jews who died in the Holocaust , were used in debt settlements between the two countries after the World War Two . "
985," Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati , unveiling first findings of a special government commission , said that in 1970s the then communist Poland received 460,000 Swiss francs from the accounts . "
986,"   In 1970s , Poland received from unclaimed accounts in Switzerland a sum of 460,000 francs . "
987," What was its right ( to the money ) ...I do not know ,   Rosati told a news conference . "
988," Switzerland stands accused by Senator Alfonse D'Amato , chairman of the powerful U.S. Senate Banking Committee , of agreeing to give money to Poland from unclaimed bank accounts of Polish citizens , as part of an accord on compensating Swiss nationals whose assets had been seized in communist Poland . "
989," Many of these citizens were Jews murdered during the war , when Nazi German invaders killed most of Poland 's 3.5 million Jews . "
990, Rosati did not say whether the payment in 1970s was part of the 1949 agreement between Warsaw and Switzerland on compensation to Swiss citizens whose assets were seized by the Soviet-imposed communists authorities after World War Two . 
991,"   I expect that the commission will finish gathering information within two to three weeks and then more details will be provided ,   Rosati said . "
992, Rosati confirmed that the 1949 agreement had provided for granting Switzerland about 53 million francs and most of this sum was repaid with coal exports . 
993," He said , however , that Switzerland did get about 16,000 francs from the so-called   dead accounts   as part of the compensation . "
994,"   About 16,000 francs were seized from accounts of four or five Polish citizens , whose data we do not precisely know . "
995," The issue is of moral and legal nature , because its financial significance is small ,   Rosati said . "
996," Under pressure from international Jewish organisations , Swiss government has devised a plan to pay out millions of dollars in unclaimed bank accounts as a conciliatory gesture toward Holocaust victims . "
997, The conservative Radical Democrats ( FDP ) have said they would ask parliament next week to order Swiss banks to put some 40 million Swiss francs ( $ 31 million ) in dormant wealth into a fund earmarked for Jewish groups and charitable organisations . 
998, But Swiss banks and the country 's Jewish community voiced doubts whether the plan would work .

1000, INTERVIEW-ZYWIEC SEES NO BIG 97 NET RISE . 
1001, Steven Silber 
1002, WARSAW 1996-12-06 
1003," Polish brewer Zywiec 's 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges , but recent high investment should help the firm defend its 10-percent market share , the firm 's chief executive said . "
1004," Company President Jean van Boxmeer told Reuters in an interview on Friday that the firm , whose net profit fell 77 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 despite a 30-percent rise in sales , might only post slightly better profits in 1997 before having a chance to make a more significant turnaround . "
1005," So far this year Zywiec , whose full name is Zaklady Piwowarskie w Zywcu SA , has netted six million zlotys on sales of 224 million zlotys . "
1006, It has produced 1.5 million hectolitres . 
1007, Van Boxmeer would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading Polish brewers should rise as the country 's young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer . 
1008,"   The perspective on growth is such that reasonably we can think that somewhere between 65 and 80 litres per year is certainly reachable ,   van Boxmeer said on Polish per-capita beer consumption , currently around 40 litres . "
1009," He said the 65-80-litre level could be reached in the next ten years and make Poland , with its 40-million population , Europe 's third largest beer market after Germany and Britain . "
1010," Van Boxmeer said Poland 's top five brewers , which produce about 55 percent of the country 's beer , could all raise market share as some of the numerous small brewers fall to competition from the large brewers with foreign investors . "
1011, Zywiec is 31.8-percent owned by Heineken while Carlsberg has the same amount in Okocim . 
1012," Earlier this year South African Breweries Ltd ( SAB ) bought strategic stakes in the unlisted Lech and Tychy brewers , which together hold more than 20 percent of the market , and Australia 's Brewpole BV has a controlling stake in Poland 's larges t brewery , Elbrewery Company Ltd. ( EB ) . "
1013," Van Boxmeer said the tough competition had prevented Zywiec from raising prices in line with inflation , which had added to the pressure on the firm 's margins . "
1014, He said advertising costs would also increase in the fight for market share . 
1015," But he said the company 's investment of more than $ 100 million already this decade , largely in production , would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring Czech Republic . "
1016," Some analysts say cheaper but high-quality Czech imports could invade Poland once tariffs for CEFTA countries are lifted in 1998 , but van Boxmeer says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the Czech beer market 's overcapacity . "
1017,   I think Polish consumers in general are quite proud of their beers -- and I 'm speaking about all the brands -- and as we make good beers ... 
1018," I think that this fidelity to our beers is a factor which can limit the Czech beers ,   he said . "
1019," Van Boxmeer said Zywiec had its eye on Okocim , which has said it would start producing Carlsberg beer next year , but that Zywiec 's potential production of Heineken was a medium-term possibility rather than a short-term one . "
1020," He said his firm would be better off concentrating on its leading brand , Zywiec Full Light , which accounts for 85 percent of sales and is the country 's largest-selling brand . "
1021,"   You will not win the war of the Polish beer market with imported international brands ,   van Boxmeer said , adding that Heineken would remain an up-market import in Poland . "
1022, Van Boxmeer also said Zywiec would be boosted by its recent shedding of soft drinks which only accounted for about three percent of the firm 's overall sales and for which 7.6 million zlotys in provisions had already been made .

1067, Britain sets conditions to clear American alliance . 
1068, Edna Fernandes 
1069, LONDON 1996-12-06 
1070, The British government warned Friday that it would refer the proposed trans-Atlantic alliance between British Airways Plc and American Airlines to Britain 's Monopolies and Mergers Commission unless the carriers complied with a number of conditions . 
1071," Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang added that even if the conditions were met by both airlines , final clearance would hinge on an open skies deal between Britain and the United States to liberalise trans-Atlantic air traffic , which would create greater competition on the routes . "
1072," Lang said he supported conditions proposed by Britain 's Office of Fair Trading , which was asked to examine the case last month . "
1073,"   I agree ... that without suitable undertakings the alliance would be likely to lead to a significant loss of actual and potential passengers , on those routes where BA and AA currently compete and for all passengers on the trans-Atlantic market route between the UK and U.S. ,   he said . "
1074, His comments came just minutes after the latest set of open skies talks ended in London with no deal signed . 
1075, Industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks and blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the British Airways-American deal would be cleared . 
1076," The conditions for clearance of the alliance were that British Airways and American drop 168 slots at London Heathrow airport , the busiest in Europe . "
1077," American 's parent , AMR Corp. , said it did not view the terms as a   deal breaker .   "
1078," However , it called the conditions   more severe   than those imposed by other regulatory authorities on similar airline alliances . "
1079, British Airways 's initial response was that   unconditional divestiture of slots is unprecedented and if done it must be on the basis of fair market value .   
1080, It added that it would be   prepared to take reasonable steps to assist the introduction of additional competition .   
1081," The government also wants British Airways to drop a clause in its agreement with USAir that bars it from competing on trans-Atlantic routes , and said both British Airways and American should be prepared to reduce services on the London to Dallas-Fort Worth route in the event that a new entrant wishes to enter . "
1082, It also suggested losing some slots on the London-to-Boston route . 
1083, The Office of Fair Trade called for British Airways / American to allow third-party access to their joint frequent flyer programme where the applicant does not have access to an equivalent programme . 
1084," Lang said responses should be made to the Office of Fair Trading by Jan. 10 , 1997 . "

1228, Homestake Mining Co tops Wall Street 's list as the most likely white knight buyer for Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corp if Santa Fe rejects unsolicited suitor Newmont Mining Corp . 
1229," Santa Fe is so far mum on the more than $ 2 billion stock swap takeover proposal from Newmont , announced Thursday . "
1230," Wall Street , since the bid , has speculated that any deal between Newmont and Santa Fe would be a   bear hug ,   or a reluctantly negotiated agreement where the buyer is not necessarily a friendly suitor . "
1231," Newmont said the companies have had previous contact , though declined to detail the encounters . "
1232," Analysts predict Santa Fe will go to the highest bidder , and that if a rival buyer is found , Newmont may not be able to match its offer . "
1233," They said the Santa Fe deal , which includes desirable Nevada mining territory , would only payoff for Newmont longer term . "
1234," Newmont , in fact , will not benefit from the Santa Fe acquisition on an earnings basis for at least two years , which also limits its capacity to raise its offer . "
1235," Any deal , friendly or hostile , would almost assuredly be a stock swap , which is necessary to preserve the tax-free , pooling-of-interest accounting , they said . "
1236, Analysts and arbitrageurs immediately ruled out Barrick Gold Corp and Bre-X Minerals Ltd as Santa Fe saviors because they are locked in negotiations over their splitting Indonesia 's Busang vast gold deposit . 
1237," Placer Dome Inc too was considered unlikley because it is focusing on geographic expansion in areas that do match Santa Fe 's Nevada , South America and Central Asia presence , they said . "
1238, A Homestake spokesman was not immediately available to comment on speculation that it tops the list . 
1239," Homestake , based in San Francisco , operates gold mines in the United States , Australia , Chile and Canada . "
1240," Earnings in 1995 were $ 0.22 per share , or $ 30.3 million , on revenues of $ 746.3 million . "
1241," Santa Fe is headquartered Albuquerque , N.M. and reported 1995 earnings of $ 0.30 per share , or $ 40 million , on revenues of $ 350 million . "
1242," Santa Fe has mining and exploration operations in Nevada , California , Montana , Canada , Brazil , Australia , Chile , Kazakstan , Mexico and Ghana . "
1243," PaineWebber analyst Marc Cohen said he lowered his rating on Newmont to neutral from attractive today because if Newmont merged with Santa Fe , investors would have to wait until the second half of 1998 to realize earnings accretion . "
1244,"   I think Homestake could come in as a white knight , but how much is someone willing to come in above the Newmont number . "
1245," One would have to outbid by at least 15 percent , but there is going to be a ( Santa Fe ) deal with someone ,   he said . "
1246,"   Longer term , two to three years out , ( a Newmont-Santa Fe deal ) is positive , it does all the right things . "
1247," But in the near-term it is , at worst , neutral ,   the analyst added . "
1248, Newmont proposed to Santa Fe a stock-swap merger at a ratio of 0.33 Newmont shares for each Santa Fe shares . 
1249," In Friday New York Stock Exchange trade , Newmonth was off 1/2 to 46-5/8 while Santa Fe added 1/4 to 15-1/8 . "
1250,"   Newmont said it wants to discuss a friendly deal with Santa Fe , which is almost always a euphemism for ' We have more money in our pocket , '   said an arb , referring to a possible sweetened bid from Newmont . "
1251," Two other arbs called Newmont 's move a   a 32 cent bid   because there is no formal tender offer , only the proposal letter   mailed   to Santa Fe 's board . "

1267, NAIROBI 1996-12-06 
1268," The Canadian general in charge of a multinational force for eastern Zaire said on Friday he was going back to Zaire for more information about the plight of about 165,000 Rwandan refugees adrift in the countryside . "
1269," Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril told a news conference in Nairobi his main concern was for a large group of about 150,000 refugees living off the land in a valley about 65 km ( 40 miles ) west of the eastern city of Goma . "
1270," If he decided it was necessary and safe for the aircrew , he would not hesitate to order airdrops of food for the refugees , even against the wishes of the government in Kinshasa and the Zairean rebels who control much of eastern Zaire , he said . "
1271,"   Tomorrow I 'm going into Rwanda and my intention is to go across into eastern Zaire and try to find out for the second time what the situation is on the ground ,   he said . "
1272, General Baril saw rebel leader Laurent Kabila in Goma last week but the rebels told him the crisis was over because most of the Rwandan refugees have already gone home . 
1273," The rebels do not want the multinational force to deploy on the ground , for fear it might help the Zairean army regain control of the area . "
1274," Kinshasa opposes airdrops , apparently because the food could fall into the hands of the rebels and their local supporters . "
1275, Canadian Defence Minister Doug Young said on Thursday that the multinational force would probably not have to make food airdrops or intervene militarily in any major way . 
1276,"   It does n't look as though they ( airdrops ) are going to be required in any significant way because the NGOs ( non-governmental organisations ) are in that area on the border between Zaire and Rwanda ,   Young told reporters . "
1277, But General Baril said it would be premature to rule out any course of action until he had more information . 
1278,   We hope that if the front moves forward or stabilises then we will have access ( to the large group of refugees ) with reconnaissance or humanitarian agencies . 
1279,"   If they ca n't move because they are too weak , then we will probably consider very seriously using air delivery means ( airdrops ) ...It 's complex , it 's dangerous for the air crew that fly in there and it will have to be absolutely necessary . "
1280," If it is necessary , I wo n't hesitate to use it ,   he said . "
1281," Asked if he would disregard the objections of the Zairean government , he said :   It would have to be in the last resort . "
1282, It would have to mean that tens of thousands of lives are in danger . 
1283, Do you think that I would have a conscience problem doing it or not at that time ? 
1284, And my mandate is also under Chapter Seven to operate in eastern Zaire .   
1285," Under Chapter Seven of the U.N. charter , the Security Council has wide powers to preserve peace and security . "
1286,"   I know their ( the Zairean government 's ) position and I know it 's very delicate and we are very sensitive to their position also ,   the general added . "
1287," He denied that his contacts , criticised by Kinshasa , with the Zairean rebels amounted to negotiations . "
1288,"   I do n't negotiate ,   he said .   "
1289, I coordinate with those who are holding ground and that 's a wise thing to do . 
1290," When we do n't know where the front is , we do n't know what the risk is .   "
1291," Baril said that apart from the group of 150,000 , U.S. and British reconnaissance plans had tracked two much smaller groups of refugees -- one of up to 1,000 north of the town of Masisi and one of up to 8,000 on the road from Bukavu west to Kindu . "
1292," The Kisangani office of the medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres said on Friday that more than 100,000 refugees were trekking northwest from the Goma-Bukavu area and many of them were now in the town of Walikale . "
1293," The general did not mention these refugees , who are on the outer limit of the strip the planes have been checking . "

1330," The bodies were found on Thursday in an open field about two km ( one mile ) further away , said Dofora and other witnesses . "

1394," Russian Finance Minister Alexander Livshits warned financially-troubled Norilsk Nickel on Friday that it must pay overdue taxes , but analysts said the firm would not be liquidated or that its would assets would be frozen . "
1395,"   Norilsk really is a big debtor , both to the federal and regional budgets ,   said Konstantin Chernyshev , equities analyst at Moscow brokerage Rinaco Plus and a Norilsk watcher .   "
1396, Livshits 's words are an attempt to put pressure on the company .   
1397, The official Itar-Tass news agency quoted Livshits as telling parliamentary deputies that RAO Norilsky Nikel 0#NKEL.RUO had to pay its tax arrears and that bankruptcy procedures applied to the metals group . 
1398,"   If it was an unsolicited statement and a bolt out of the blue , then it obviously means something ,   said Christopher Granville , chief economist at United City Bank in Moscow . "
1399,"   But if it was a response to a deputy 's question that was essentially loaded , then it was the only answer he could have given .   "
1400," Russian tax and cabinet authorities , under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to boost tax revenues as a condition for receiving payments of a $ 10 billion , three-year loan to Moscow , have been striking fear into the hearts of some of Russia 's most prominent industrial firms by saying they must pay up or face liquidation . "
1401,"   They could freeze metal , but it 's not a long-term solution to the problem and would n't put money in the budget ,   Chernyshev said .   "
1402, I do n't think they would do that .   
1403," Entire social infrastructures in the icy Far North where Norilsk is based depend on the company , and Moscow has said it has no finances to resettle hundreds of thousands of people -- an expenditure which could far outstrip Norilsk 's debts . "
1404, Norilsk officials declined to comment . 
1405," Analysts said the government , while anxious about Norilsk 's debts , is highly unlikely to bring the nickel , copper , cobalt , platinum and platinum group metals producer to its knees or take measures that could significantly affect output . "
1406," But it also wants Norilsk , the world 's second-largest nickel producer , to clean up its act . "
1407,"   The procedure of bankruptcy will be applied ,   Tass quoted Livshits as telling Duma deputies about Norilsk . "
1408," It indirectly quoted him as saying Norilsk should first pay salary arrears , which in the past have led to worker strikes . "
1409,"   It is unlikely that Norilsk will pay these debts in the near-term -- the company will remain a debtor in the near future ,   Chernyshev said . "
1410, He estimated the company 's regional debts at least one trillion roubles and said 30 percent of the giant Krasnoyarsk regional budget was fuelled by Norilsk money . 
1411," Norilsk 's new majority shareholder , Russian commerical bank Uneximbank , has said it is reorganising metal exports through Interrosimpex in order to boost revenues . "
1412, But the changes have yet to improve significantly Norilsk 's situation . 
1413,"   Uneximbank has inherited a mountain and whether or not they climb out and over it remains to be seen ,   said one metals source . "
1414," Norilsk said in September that it total debts , including unpaid salaries to workers , were 13 trillion roubles . "
1415," The company said last month that it had worked out a tax payment schedule with authorities , after regional tax officials threatened to seize some nickel and copper assets . "

1482," Then once we saw the Dow ( Jones industrial average ) was not about to crash , some buyers stepped in ,   said a trader , referring to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan , whose comments that assets were   irrationally exhuberant   upset financial markets worldwide . "

1501, Plastic surgery gets boost in Brazil .

1503, RIO DE JANEIRO 1996-12-06 
1504," Plastic surgery is booming , especially among men , as Brazilians spend much of their new-found wealth on the latest beauty treatments , said the organisers of a four-day international plastic surgery conference that opened on Friday . "
1505," The number of plastic surgeries in Brazil has jumped 30 percent to an estimated 150,000 this year since an anti-inflation plan was introduced in July 1994 , Farid Hakme , the president of the Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society ( SBCP ) , said . "
1506," The number of operations on men increased even more -- by 80 percent , from 8,000 in 1994 to 15,000 in 1995 , he said . "
1507,"   Brazil ranks right at the top for plastic surgery with respect to the number of surgeons , the number of patients , number of operations , number of conferences . "
1508," Our statistics are the highest for everything ,   Hakme said . "
1509,   We believe the increase in plastic surgeries for men results from the difficulties in the job market . 
1510," People need to have a more youthful look to compete in the job market , given the profound changes in Latin America 's economy .   "
1511," A controlled exchange rate , trade liberalisation and tight monetary policies have also dramatically curbed inflation , making more money available for cosmetic surgery . "
1512," Brazil has been at the forefront in plastic surgery for decades and is home to one of the most famous surgeons , Ivo Pitangy . "
1513," There are 6,000 plastic surgeons there , of which 4,500 have qualified to be members of the SBCP . "
1514," Every year , 500 new plastic surgeons graduate in Brazil and medical students from all over the world come to study there . "
1515," Hakme attributes Brazil 's fascination with plastic surgery not to excessive vanity but to the country 's mix and match of different races , which can create physical disharmonies .   "
1516," What happens is the nose sometimes does n't match the mouth or the buttocks do n't match with the legs ,   he said . "
1517," Brazil 's most sought-after beauty treatment is liposuction in which fat is sucked away from areas of the body , with about 30,000 operations a year at a cost of $ 3,000 to $ 4,000 each . "
1518," Stomach tucks and breast operations are also popular since the tropical climate calls for flesh-baring fashions , but unlike women elsewhere Brazilians tend to have breast reductions and buttock implants . "
1519,"   The women who want to reduce their breasts here would probably want to increase them in the United States ,   SBCP Vice-President Oswaldo Saldanha said .   "
1520, Beauty ideals and cultures are different in every country .   
1521, Plastic surgery scares like the case in which Brazilian model Claudia Liz fell into a coma after being anaesthetised for a liposuction in October are not much of a deterrent . 
1522, Saldanha said operations fell 30 percent immediately after that case but the rate was back to normal now .

1575, East Timorese Roman Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo left Dili on Friday on his way to Norway for the awards ceremony as co-recipient of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize . 
1576, Witnesses said Belo left the territory for the Indonesian capital Jakarta accompanied by five other people . 
1577, It was not immediately known when he would arrive in Oslo . 
1578," The bishop will jointly receive the Nobel award next Tuesday with East Timorese-born activist Jose Ramos Horta , who lives in self-exile in Australia . "
1579," The Indonesian government has condemned the inclusion of Ramos Horta in the award , and Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said on Friday that Indonesia would not be represented officially at the ceremony in the Norwegian capital . "
1580,   I sincerely believe that this unfortunate choice in giving the honour to such a controversial figure as Ramos Horta ... 
1581," will exacerbate the problem in finding a solution ( to East Timor ) ,   Alatas said on Friday . "
1582, He was responding to questions at a news conference called to discuss next week 's ministerial meeting of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference ( OIC ) in Jakarta . 
1583, Ramos Horta has been a vocal leader of the opposition to Jakarta 's rule in the territory . 
1584," Belo and Ramos Horta were awared the prize for their efforts to secure a peaceful solution to the issue of East Timor , a former Portuguese colony which Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year . "
1585, The United Nations has never recognised Jakarta 's move . 
1586, Alatas said the government 's position on the Nobel Peace Prize would have been different if it had been awarded solely to Belo . 
1587," Asked if the Indonesian ambassador to Norway would have attended the ceremony if only Belo had been involved , Alatas replied :   Probably , yes , but that is a hypothetical question .   "
1588," Alatas said on Tuesday that on his way back from Oslo , Belo would visit the Vatican to see the Pope , and would also meet German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn . "

1612," About 200 Burmese students marched briefly from troubled Yangon Institute of Technology in northern Rangoon on Friday towards the University of Yangon six km ( four miles ) away , and returned to their campus , witnesses said . "
1613, Seven truckloads of armed riot police and three fire engines were on standby at one of the junctions near the institute . 
1614, There were no clashes . 
1615,"   They are now back in the YIT campus ,   an institute official who declined to be identified told Reuters by telephone . "
1616, One of two roads leading to the University of Yangon from the institute had been closed by authorities . 
1617," But about 300 university students were still gathered outside the gates of their campus , witnesses said . "
1618, They were singing peacefully . 
1619," On Monday and Tuesday , students from the institute and the university launched protests against what they said was unfair handling by police of a brawl between some of their colleagues and restaurant owners in October . "
1620," On Tuesday and Wednesday , opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was restricted to her home by the military government to prevent her from being drawn into the protests . "
1621, She was allowed to move freely on Thursday . 
1622, The protest culminated at dawn on Tuesday with several hundred students being detained briefly by police in central Rangoon . 
1623, The street protests were the biggest seen in the capital since the student-led pro-democracry demonstrations of September 1988 when the junta crushed the uprising . 
1624, Thousands were killed or imprisoned . 
1625," Earlier on Friday some of the students , who were held briefly by police during the protests earlier this week , said they were still dissatisfied with the military government . "
1626, They told Reuters they were unhappy that the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council ( SLORC ) had not heeded their calls for the right to organise independent unions on campus . 
1627,   We still want government answers to our demands . 
1628," We want police punishment to be published in newspapers ,   one student said . "
1629, But the students stressed their protests were non-political and they had no contact with Suu Kyi 's National League for Democracy ( NLD ) . 
1630," Suu Kyi , a Nobel laureate and daughter of independence hero Aung San , and key NLD officials have also denied any link with the students . "
1631, But they have said both parties had a   moral link   in that they were against police brutality and injustice . 
1632, The students also demanded the government announce punishments meted out to policemen who they said had manhandled students involved in a brawl with some restaurant owners near the Yangon institute in October . 
1633, The students appealed to the government not to close the institute because of their latest demonstration . 
1634, The institute was shut for nearly two years after the 1988 uprising .

1638, SINGAPORE 1996-12-06 
1639, International trade union leaders on Friday expressed outrage that the head of the International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) had been barred from speaking at next week 's WTO meeting in Singapore . 
1640," Bill Jordan , general secretary of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( ICFTU ) , told a news conference the withdrawal of a WTO invitation to ILO director general Michel Hansenne was   outrageous behaviour on the part of an organisation that wants to command respect in the world   . "
1641, Jordan said a small group of developing nations that oppose linking trade talks and labour conditions had pressured World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) officials to prevent Hansenne from taking the platform to urge such links . 
1642,"   It is to their shame that those who are responsible for encouraging this meeting responded ( to the pressure ) in silencing him ,   Jordan said after the opening of an ICFTU conference on international labour standards and trade . "
1643, The three-day trade union conference in Singapore hopes to push labour issues onto the WTO agenda . 
1644, Jordan said the WTO 's credibility was at stake over the issue of trade and labour . 
1645," The ICFTU said it wanted the WTO conference beginning on Monday to outlaw forced and child labour , end discrimination in hiring , and guarantee the right to join a union . "
1646," Bill Brett , chairman of the ILO Workers Group , told Reuters before the news conference he was   not too surprised , but very disappointed   that the speaking invitation had been withdrawn . "
1647,"   Some governments are very determined to stop the issue ( of trade and labour rights ) being discussed ,   he said , adding that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) seemed particularly hostile to the ILO agenda . "
1648," ASEAN groups Brunei , Indonesia , Malaysia , the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand and Vietnam . "
1649," The ILO wants a trade and labour rights   social clause   included in the final ministerial statement issued by WTO leaders at the end of the meeting , the organization 's first ministerial-level gathering . "
1650," Speaking to ICFTU delegates , Richard Eglin , director of the WTO secretariat , said the WTO was capable of making a significant contribution to governmental efforts to solve social problems . "

1653, Indian rubber demand seen outstripping production . 
1654, SINGAPORE 1996-12-06 
1655," Indian rubber demand is seen outpacing local production in the 1996/97 April / March season and the trend will persist way into the next century , the chairman of the Rubber Board of India said on Friday . "
1656," K.J. Matthew said at the Asia Rubber Markets meeting here Indian production of natural rubber in 1996/97 will reach 547,000 tonnes against projected demand of 578,000 tonnes , a gap of 31,000 tonnes . "
1657," For synthetic rubber , production reached 68,200 tonnes in 1995/96 while consumption in the same season hit 134,085 tonnes , Matthew added . "
1658,"   Though schemes designed to realise further increases in the production of natural rubber are being operated successfully , the demand-supply gap is expected to widen ,   he said . "
1659," Indian synthetic rubber output is not expected to rise significantly in the next season but demand will rise to 145,000 tonnes . "
1660," Matthew estimates that by the 2000/01 season , the gap between natural rubber output and consumption will rise to 51,000 tonnes and 319,000 tonnes in 2010/11 . "
1661," Natural rubber production will go up to 695,000 tonnes in 2000/01 against consumption of 746,000 tonnes . "
1662," In 2010/11 , domestic demand should rise further to 1.233 million tonnes while production will only reach about 914,000 tonnes . "
1663," One way to bridge the widening gap is to put more land under cultivation which the Rubber Board official estimates will reach 220,000 hectares between now and the year 2003 although Matthew said this may not be possible at this time in India . "
1664,"   The development objective for the rubber plantation industry will be to increase production to the best extent possibly with a view to minimising imports of natural rubber ,   he said . "

1670," Comments by Japan 's tight-lipped central bank chief and an influential top bureaucrat are further signs that the nation 's authorities want to keep the dollar at current levels , market sources said on Friday . "
1671," In a rare expression of a view on currencies by the Bank of Japan ( BOJ ) governor , Yasuo Matsushita was quoted in Japan 's leading economic daily on Friday as saying that he sees no further , immediate fall in the yen . "
1672," This followed a widely watched television appearance late on Thursday by Eisuke Sakakibara , a high-ranking Finance Ministry official , who denied he had said he wants to guide the dollar lower to between 108 and 110 yen . "
1673," But many in the market thought Sakakibara 's real intentions lay elsewhere , and took more notice of his comments about the U.S. government 's stance on the dollar , dealers said . "
1674,"   I think his views on ( U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert ) Rubin 's comments were indeed what he himself thinks about the dollar ,   said Hank Note , chief dealer at Sumitomo Bank . "
1675," Asked about Rubin 's comment that a strong dollar was in U.S. interests , Sakakibara said the remark does not necessarily mean the United States supports a stronger dollar . "
1676,"   It 's a strong dollar , not stronger . "
1677," In that sense , the comments are not pointing to a certain direction ,   he said . "
1678,"   It shows that Sakakibara is not for a stronger dollar either ,   said Sumitomo 's Note . "
1679," Takao Sakoh , first vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in Tokyo , said :   Maybe a dollar at 104.50 yen is not acceptable ( to Sakakibara ) , but it may be okay at the current level , at the lower end of 112 yen .   "
1680," Market participants have kept a close eye on Sakakibara , chief of the ministry 's International Finance Bureau , as a comment he made in November after the dollar hit this year 's high of 114.92 yen pushed the currency down sharply . "
1681, He had said then that the market 's view on Japan 's economy was too pessimistic and that he believed it was stronger than the market thought . 
1682, Dealers have come to refer to 115 yen as the   Sakakibara ceiling   for the dollar following the remark . 
1683," Adding to the comments by   Mr Yen   , as Sakakibara is known for his prominence in the currency market , was BOJ governor Matsushita 's remark . "
1684,"   The recent level of the yen exchange rate has been stable , and it does not appear to be moving towards a further depreciation of the yen immediately , so import prices are likely to stabilise at current levels ,   Matsushita said in an interview with the Nihon Keizai Shimbun . "
1685,"   The fact that he touched on the issue of inflation triggered by import prices shows that the BOJ does not want a further depreciation of the yen , past 115 yen ,   said Yasuhito Kawashima , chief forex manager at Toyo Trust & Banking Co . "
1686, Some said the central bank may have been concerned a weaker yen would lead to unfounded pessimism about Japan 's economy . 
1687,   There was concern that foreign investors may sell Japanese stocks if the dollar goes above 115 yen . 
1688," The BOJ does not want the yen 's weakness to lead to pessimism over the economy ,   said Taisuke Tanaka , market strategist with Credit Suisse in Tokyo . "
1689, Senior BOJ officials have separately said financial markets ' views on the economy have been too negative . 
1690,"   I realise there are negative views in the markets about the impact of the consumption tax hike and drop in public spending , but the markets appear to be exaggerating the magnitude of the negative impact ,   a senior BOJ official told Reuters on Friday . "
1691, The consumption tax is due to raised in April from three to five percent .

1695, BEIRUT 1996-12-06 
1696, A Lebanese military court on Friday sentenced to death in absentia the commander of Israel 's surrogate militia in south Lebanon on treason charges . 
1697," The court convicted General Antoine Lahd , head of the South Lebanon Army ( SLA ) , of collaborating with Israel with which Lebanon is officially at war . "
1698," Lahd , a 69-year-old former Lebanese army major-general , heads the 3,000-strong SLA militia which helps Israel hold a border zone in south Lebanon to ward off cross-frontier guerrilla raids on northern Israel . "
1699, Lahd said a few days after the trial began on February 16 that Lebanese authorities must drop the charges or risk blocking any peace deal with the Jewish state . 
1700, He said Israel was capable of pressuring Lebanon 's Syrian-backed government to stop the legal pursuit . 
1701," The charges against Lahd were : forming a hostile army , carrying weapons on Israel 's side , helping Israel strip off a part of Lebanese territory by violence , forming an armed gang , killing or trying to kill Lebanese civilians by artillery shelling and kidnapping Lebanese citizens for long periods . "
1702," Shortly before Lahd 's trial began , a Beirut military prosecutor charged another 89 former Lebanese army soldiers with collaborating with Israel . "
1703," No date has been set for the trial of the men , all members of the SLA living in the Israeli-held zone in south Lebanon . "
1704, Israel and Lahd have repeatedly demanded safety guarantees for the SLA -- a mixed Christian-Shi'ite Moslem force -- which the Jewish states regards as loyal allies . 
1705, Israel has said the Lebanese army must incorporate the SLA fighters into its ranks as an army brigade as a condition for peace . 
1706, But Lebanese political analysts have said that would be out of the question and Lebanese authorities pre-empted the issue by taking legal action against Lahd . 
1707," Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres , calling Lahd   a great Lebanese patriot   , said earlier this year Lebanon had insulted the SLA commander by ordering his arrest on the treason charges . "
1708," Peres , who was ousted in May by rightwing Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu , said there could not be real negotiations with Lebanon   unless it will stop the maltreatment of the SLA and its commanders .   "
1709," The Beirut military court also sentenced to life in jail in absentia Etian Saqr , former head of the pro-Israeli Guardians of the Cedars , a small rightwing Christian civil war militia . "
1710," Saqr , whose trial was concurrent with Lahd 's , was convicted of   contacting the Israeli enemy , passing information to Israel and undertaking hostile acts against Lebanon   . "

1774," , 41 , was put to death in Florida 's electric chair Friday . "
1775," As Glenn Lawhon , a rural Florida minister who is the victim 's father , looked on , Mills was pronounced dead at 7:13 a.m. EST ( 1213 GMT ) for the murder of Lester Lawhon . "
1776," Speaking in Arabic , Mills made a final statement before an anonymous citizen flipped the switch that sent 2000 volts of electricity through his body , said Department of Corrections spokesman Eugene Morris , who was present at the execution . "
1777,"   I bear witness that there is no God but Allah and I bear witness that the prophet Mohammed is the messenger of God ,   he quoted Mills as saying . "
1778," Prison officials said they had no record of Mills ' official conversion , but they said that , on May 14 , 1991 , he had asked that a new name , Yuhanna Abdullah Muhammed , be added to his prison file , which is usually an indication of a conversion to Islam . "
1779, Mills is the 38th person to die in Florida 's electric chair since the U.S. Supreme Court reversed itself in 1976 and legalised the death penalty . 
1780," Prison officials said Mills made no special request for a last meal and did not eat the steak , fried potatoes and orange juice offered him . "
1781," He spent Thursday with family members and his spiritual adviser , Morris said . "
1782, Mills was scheduled to die Wednesday but had his sentence temporarily postponed by the Florida Supreme Court . 
1783," On Thursday , the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta denied his appeal in federal court . "
1784," In March 1982 , Mills and accomplice Michael Frederick knocked on the door of Lester Lawhon 's trailer in an attempt to rob it , police said . "
1785, Lester Lawhon was taken to a nearby airstrip where he was bludgeoned with a tire iron . 
1786, Mills then fired two shots that killed Lawhon as the victim tried to run away .

1927, CHICAGO 1996-12-06 
1928," As many as 1 million dog bites are recorded in the United States every year and half of them are provoked by humans , a veterinarian told fellow animal doctors on Friday . "
1929," The Humane Society of the United States estimates that between 500,000 and one million bites are delivered by dogs each year , more than half of which are suffered by children . "
1930,"   Most bites can be prevented by teaching children how to respect a dog ,   Michael Cornwell of the Glencoe Animal Hospital in Columbus , Ohio , told the annual meeting of the American Veterinary Medical Association . "
1931,   Let 's not let our kids jump on them or crawl on them . 
1932, Dogs and children do n't have to have an interaction . 
1933," Let 's respect their territories ,   he said . "
1934, Cornwell said 50 percent of reported bites were provoked by a person and 60 percent were suffered by children . 
1935, He also estimated that only 25 percent of bites were reported because medical attention was not needed . 
1936," Don Rieck , president of the National Animal Control Association , said aggressiveness in dogs was related more to gender than breed and a male dog that had not been neutered was three times more likely to bite than an unspayed female . "
1937," The five breeds credited with the most incidents were chow chows , Rottweilers , German shepherds , cocker spaniels and Dalmatians .   "
1938, The trends in dog bites by particular breeds have more to do with fad pets owned by individuals who need to have something unique . 
1939," Speaking strictly of dogs , 15 years ago the macho fad pet was a Doberman . "
1940," Today , Rottweilers are on the way up ,   Rieck said . "
1941," If approached by a stray dog , children should be taught to stand still with fists folded underneath the neck , elbows in , and gaze forward until the dog goes away . "

1965, Four African states are ready to nominate candidates for the post of U.N. secretary-general on Friday now that Boutros Boutros-Ghali has temporarily put aside his bid for re-election . 
1966," The nominees , according to diplomats , are : Kofi Annan of Ghana , the U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeeping ; Ahmedou Ould Abdallah of Mauritania , the former U.N. special envoy for Burundi ; Amara Essy of the Ivory Coast , its foreign minister and the U.N. General Assembly president in 1994-95 ; and Hamid Algabid of Niger , the secretary-general of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference . "
1967," Representatives of the U.N. missions of Ghana , the Ivory Coast , Mauritania and Niger have scheduled a meeting with Security Council president Paolo Fulci of Italy to hand in the nominations in writing , the envoys said . "
1968, It was not known if other candidates would step forward . 
1969," Diplomats said General Joseph Garba of Nigeria , a U.N. General Assembly president in 1989-90 , was putting forth his own candidacy without being nominated by his country . "
1970, Boutros-Ghali on Wednesday opened the door for other Africans to contest his job by saying he was suspending temporarily his candidacy but was not withdrawing completely from the race . 
1971, His supporters said this meant he remained a candidate in case the race reached an impasse . 
1972, The United States on Nov. 19 vetoed his bid for re-election while the other 14 Security Council members supported him . 
1973," The move by the African states means that the council could begin voting on candidates next week , a procedure that could either result in a decision or turn into a bitter fight with vetoes against each nominee . "
1974, The Security Council has to vote on a new secretary-general and then seek the endorsement of the 185-members General Assembly before December 31 when Boutros-Ghali 's term expires .

2207," Rashid , 46 , was sentenced to 18 years in prison by a Greek court in 1992 after being convicted of premeditated murder in the mid-air bombing of a Pan American airliner in 1982 . "

2495," Another source said most of the key negotiators from both Bre-X and Barrick had returned to Toronto , but declined to say if there had been any progress in their negotiations . "

2521, FEATURE - Singapore sees prestige in hosting WTO . 
2522, Ramthan Hussain 
2523, SINGAPORE 1996-12-06 
2524," Singapore 's winning campaign to host the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) 's first ministerial meeting reflected its ambition to play a key role in shaping global free trade , the lifeblood of its economy , analysts said . "
2525,"   As one of the world 's most externally oriented economies , Singapore has a disproportionately large stake in the WTO ,   said Desmond Supple , economist at research house I.D.E.A . "
2526,"   Singapore stands to benefit more than most from continued global trade liberalisation as trade is the engine of its growth , accounting for nearly three times its gross domestic product .   "
2527," The city-state met U.S. opposition two years ago in its bid to host the meeting , expected to gather 4,000 officials from 160 countries from December 9 to 13 . "
2528," In a stand some analysts linked to controversy over Singapore 's caning of an American teenager for vandalism , then-U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor had said the meeting ought to be held where the WTO was going to be headquartered . "
2529, That would have meant Geneva . 
2530, But Singapore had the support of other WTO members . 
2531," Derek da Cunha , senior fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies ( ISEAS ) , said Singapore 's hosting of the conference   carries a great deal of symbolism for the city-state , underscoring its commitment to free trade and its trading links across the globe .   "
2532," There is the international prestige Singapore would enjoy , but   more importantly there is a genuine national interest in fostering better global free trade and an open market   , said Tan Kong Yam , head of Business Policy at the National University of Singapore . "
2533," At the ministerial meeting , trade ministers will review the work of the WTO and the implementation of the Uruguay Round free trade commitments under its predecessor the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) . "
2534," In June , the WTO hailed Singapore for its open market policies but the European Union and other trading powers called on Singapore to speed up the opening of its services sector . "
2535, Supple said the struggle that Singapore had to wage in vying to host the meeting would be repeated during the talks . 
2536,"   There is tension at every step of the way ,   since a battle line between the West and developing countries has been drawn over the issue of linking trade liberalisation with labour rights , he said . "
2537," Supple said hosting the meeting carried prestige for Singapore ,   however , this is quite intangible as the prestige factor may not necessarily lead to any additional investment and trade flows to this region .   "
2538," From a commercial point of view , the meeting would be good for Singapore 's tourism industry , Tan said . "
2539," A large part of Singapore 's workforce would be mobilised to ensure the meeting would run without a glitch but the average Singaporean   would probably not be too concerned about some of the issues ,   Tan said . "
2540,   But the more educated public will realise that these kind of things are important for Singapore as a small economy .   
2541, Supple said any political gains the Singapore government would get from the WTO meeting -- ahead of a general election due by April 1997 -- would depend on how successful it was in pushing its economic agenda . 
2542,"   If there are any movements toward freer trade , then Singapore 's economy and the electorate would gain ,   he said .   "
2543, But I do n't think it would be wise to play up the political aspect of this . 
2544, I think political issues will take secondary importance to all these economic issues that will be displayed .

2548, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp ( NTT ) said on Friday that it hopes to move into the international telecommunications business as soon as possible following the government 's decision to split NTT into three firms under a holding company . 
2549,"   We hope to start international telephone business as soon as possible ,   a company official told Reuters . "
2550, The official said the latest government decision to split the company under a holding company would allow flexibility in NTT 's international phone business . 
2551," Earlier , Posts and Telecommunications Minister Hisao Horinouchi told a news conference the government plans to split NTT into three firms under a holding company , but did not specify when the restructuring would likely take effect . "
2552," One of the three new companies will be a long-distance operator and the other two will be local-call operators , Horinouchi said . "
2553," One of the local firms will operate in west Japan and the other in east Japan , he added . "
2554," The long-distance operator will offer international services , Horinouchi said . "
2555, The NTT official said the timing of the planned split-up was uncertain because more discussions by government officials were required .

2830, CRICKET - WOOLMER MAKES SENTIMENTAL RETURN TO KANPUR . 
2831," KANPUR , India 1996-12-07 "
2832, South Africa 's trip to Kanpur for the third test against India has given former England test cricketer Bob Woolmer the chance of a sentimental return to his birthplace . 
2833, Woolmer was born in the northern city of Kanpur when his father worked there for an insurance compnay and was himself an active cricketer . 
2834,   It 's been a sentimental journey ... 
2835," A visit to India is always an intriguing experience ,   Woolmer , now the South African coach , said on Saturday . "
2836," Woolmer , 48 , played 19 tests for England between 1975 and 1981 . "
2837, His first cricketing sojurn to India was as a member of Tony Greig 's England side in 1976-77 . 
2838," His father Clarence Woolmer represented United Province , now renamed Uttar Pradesh , in India 's Ranji Trophy national championship and captained the state during 1949 . "
2839," Now aged 86 , Woolmer senior lives with his son in Cape Town . "
2840, Woolmer 's memories of Kanpur are few and blurred . 
2841,"   I do n't remember much of the place ,   he said .   "
2842, I came here on zero and left at three ( aged three ) when my father was transferred to Calcutta where I spent another four and half years . 
2843,   But I do remember we had a cobra snake in the basement of our house . 
2844, Also that my father bought a bicycle and when we rode over a hose pipe it broke into two .   
2845, Woolmer said the hospital where he was born is close to the stadium where the India-South Africa test will be played .

2964," For the third consecutive day , Friday 's scheduled training runs were cancelled due to heavy wet snow and fog on Whistler Mountain , leaving the scheduled World Cup events in jeopardy . "
2965, Rules call for at least one training run to be completed before a World Cup downhill race can be staged . 
2966," Organisers hope to get that run in on Saturday morning , conditions permitting , and stage the race later in the day or on Sunday . "
2967,"   There was no possibility today to make a training run ,   said Bernd Zobel , the Canadian men 's national coach , citing too much new snow and poor visibility . "
2968," If organisers are forced to run the downhill on Sunday , the super-giant slalom originally scheduled for Sunday would likely be abandoned . "

3608, Galley suffered a concussion and did not return to the game . 
3609,"   Mr Bure left his feet to deliver a forearm blow to Mr Galley as he was about to be checked legally by his opponent ,   said NHL discipline chief Brian Burke in handing out the suspension . "
3610,"   Although it is clear from the videotape that Mr Bure 's actions were a reaction to the impending hit and there was no intent to injure his opponent , there can be no excuse for this type of conduct ,   Burke said . "

3673, DUBLIN 1996-12-07 
3674, Jack Charlton 's relationship with the people of Ireland was cemented on Saturday when the Englishman was officially declared one of their own . 
3675," Charlton , 61 , and his wife , Peggy , became citizens of Ireland when they formally received Irish passports from deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring who said the honour had been made in recognition of Charlton 's achievements as the national soccer manager . "
3676,   The years I spent as manager of the Republic of Ireland were the best years of my life . 
3677," It all culminated in the fact that I now have lots of great , great friends in Ireland . "
3678," That is why this is so emotional a night for me ,   Charlton said . "
3679,"   It was the joy that we all had over the period , that I shared with people that I grew to love , that I treasure most ,   he added . "
3680," Charlton managed Ireland for 93 matches , during which time they lost only 17 times in almost 10 years until he resigned in December 1995 . "
3681," He guided Ireland to two successive World Cup finals tournaments and to the 1988 European championship finals in Germany , after the Irish beat a well-fancied England team 1-0 in their group qualifier . "
3682," The lanky former Leeds United defender did not make his England debut until the age of 30 but eventually won 35 caps and was a key member of the 1966 World Cup winning team with his younger brother , Bobby . "
